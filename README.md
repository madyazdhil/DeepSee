There are approximately 6 million people in Indonesia who suffer a visual impairment and for that reason public infrastructure and all the surroundings still can not properly solve this problem. It is easy to take a walk to observe indoor rooms and nearby objects for people with normal vision. However, this cannot be done for persons with disabilities such as blind people, so they need a special device that can facilitate their mobility. One solution is to present technology that helps bridge the gap between the current conditions experienced by blind people and their expectations. Therefore, we developed an application called Deep See that is able to help blind people recognize unfamiliar indoor spaces and nearby objects accurately and responsively for everyday life. 

After all the research and development we have been able to done, the final result is in an android app form that can predict room kind and also object detection using a camera in mobile device. It give a voice output from speaker so it can be recognized. In addition to other user sector that do not have blindness we put an image uploading feature so that user can submit an image for dataset enrichment.  

Each path in this project has a concern that can briefly describe above :
Machine Learning: building and training models from specified dataset then convert it with TensorFlow lite form and set it in onder to fit with android environment
Android: Making initial app and creating structural code to integrate with ML model and cloud infrastructure
Cloud: Set infrastructure for image uploading feature and set a monitoring dashboard and also create a alerting rule to improve availability and scalability
